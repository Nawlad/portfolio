    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    
    <h2>The First Chapter</h2>

    <p>So I did something insane.</p>

<p>Many of you will be unaware but I have a long standing health condition and suffer from chronic pain. It’s something I struggle with and it feels incredibly freeing talking about it. Especially since talking about your health or being 100% all the time is the expected social norm.</p>

<p>I know that my health has created an inconvenience at times. Especially as people seem to label me as ‘lazy’ or ‘absent’ purely because sometimes I just can’t do anything or am not able to meet the expectations set. I am tired of being labelled and sterotyped in to a bad person because my health interupts my work routine and ability to function.</p>

<p>At times, the pain is so bad I can’t eat, sleep, walk or read. I’ve been having terrible migranes, I prefer dark places and my hands shake all the time. I have been hospitalised 6 times over the last 6 months. I’m constantly exhausted as the pain consumes all my energy.</p>

<p>So in the end, despite constantly feeling like a failure. And trying my best to stay afloat. I felt guilty that I couldn’t be a ‘normal’ employee. My body gave up on me and I had no choice but to leave my job. I knew that I was in a place where it would take a long time for me to recover.</p>

<p>I jumped. I left the UK and moved to Finland. Luckily I’m leaving the UK just in time for potential political armageddon. I went from living in a city of 8 million to 9,000. I’ll keep learning coding, and I’ll go through the procedures to integrate in to Finnish society. I’ll keep posting updates here and also my website. I hope this is the beginning of hope.</p>
